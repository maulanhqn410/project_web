              <p>Popular across every menu here is Nem Nuong (grilled pork roll), Nem Chua (fermented pork roll) and Tre
                (fermented pig’s ear). This is normally served as a platter along with rice paper, cucumber, fresh
                leaves and fried rice noodle roll.</p>
              <p>Nem Nuong is made from minced pork and mixed with salt, pepper, sugar, garlic and other spices. It’s
                rolled into sticks, thread onto a skewer and grilled over charcoal. Throughout the day, you will see
                many women out on the streets grilling in big batches.</p>

              <p>Tre is a treat that’s famous to Quy Nhon and it’s particular popular during Tet festival. It’s seasoned
                with sesame, galangal root, chili and garlic, and you’ll often see these wrapped in a thick roll of
                straw like a broom.</p>

              <p>You will be shown a series of tanks with a vast array of live seafood from lobsters,
                crabs
                and prawns to all different kinds of shellfish. All items are sold by by weight and their price and
                availability will depend on the catch. For a rough estimation of costs, you can expect it to be about
                400,000 vnd/kg for crabs, 600,000 vnd/kg for prawns and a starting price of 400,000 vnd/kg for fish.</p>
              <p>You can then select how you would like each to be cooked, be it grilled, fried, steamed or made into a
                soup.</p>

              <p>Some of the specialties here include crab hotpot, steamed lobsters and grilled lobsters with

                and grilled shellfish served with crushed peanuts and spring onion. To add to the experience, food is
                served at a low table and guests are seated on mats.</p>

              <p>Bánh hỏi is a Vietnamese dish consisting of rice vermicelli woven into intricate bundles and often
                topped with chopped scallions or garlic chives sauteed in oil, served with a complementary meat dish.
                The strings of noodles are usually only as thin as a toothpick; the texture is firm enough so the
                noodles do not fall apart, but is not at all sticky to keep the dish light and suitable for a breakfast
                treat. Also known as question cake or pie</p>
              <pv>When used, they often add a little peanut oil along with finely chopped chives to apply on the cake to
                add flavor. The cake is usually eaten with chives only, not for other cakes because the leaves are very
                green and have a light aroma. Shallot leaves, after finely chopped, are sautéed in cooking oil until
                fragrant. The main flavor of the cake is due to the de-oiled shallot leaves.</pv>
