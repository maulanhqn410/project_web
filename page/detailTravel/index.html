              <p>Ky Co Beach in central town Quy Nhon is known for its distinctive beauty, boasting crescent-shaped
                coastline
                and crystal-clear water.</p>
              <p>Located about 25 km northeast of Quy Nhon's center, Ky Co in Nhon Ly island commune embraces a
                captivating beauty thanks to the rocky mountains, stretches of white sand, and deep clear emerald sea
                water.</p>
              <p>The most special feature of Ky Co is definitely the two distinct shades of green/blue water, prominent
                against its white sand.</p>
              <p>The coast is curved like a crescent with three sides bordering the mountains and one side skirting the
                sea, facing out to the rocks, which might give you the impression of visiting a private island.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>From Ky Co Beach, you can rent a canoe to explore the coral at Bai Dua, Hon Kho or Hon Sao islets. Many
                visitors here go for the special diving service that allows you to walk under the sea among the swimming
                fish, kitted out with an air tank, helmet, and underwater photography gear.</p>

              <p>In addition, tourists can rent a jet ski, a boat to go fishing, or follow local fishermen out to sea.
                Or, if you are more laid back, just laze on the beach watching the turquoise sea water and listening to
                the crashing waves.</p>

              <p> There is a long wooden bridge in the middle of the beach, from which people used to jump. Now,
                however, only photography is allowed here. Near the end of the day, the wind gets stronger and the waves
                louder on Ky Co.</p>

              <p> To fully experience the beauty of Ky Co, spend at least half a day here. Do not miss the spectacular
                sunrise or sunset, and do not forget to visit nearby attraction Eo Gio Bay.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
              <p>The Banh It Towers - are located about 20 kilometers from Quy Nhon, halfway between the airport and the
                city. The Banh It Towers are included in the book "1001 buildings you must see before you die", written
                by a group of British writers. Incidentally, this is the only architectural monument in Vietnam, which
                is included in the book. The Banh It is a very picturesque complex on a prominent hill between two
                branches of the river "Con". This river flows from the citadel of the royal city of Cham (now gone) to
                the bay of Qui Nhon. The towers have had quite a bit of restoration work, but original carvings still
                adorn the walls.</p>
              <p>
                The Qui Nhon Banh It Towers is a group of four towers, known as the Silver Towers. They are one of the
                best preserved examples of late Cham architecture. The Cham kingdom ruled over southern and central
                Vietnam from the second century and reached the height of its power in the ninth century.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>The Cham were adopted Hinduism and they made it a state religion. They copied the architecture to
                Indian model to create something unique in Vietnam. This is best illustrated by Kalan. The term Kalan
                refers to one of the main towers, which is centered in this field. This is one of the most important
                objects, when they going to worship their god. In this case it's a statue of the Hindu god Shiva.</p>

              <p>In the 10th century the power of the Cham began to diminish and the late Cham architecture declined.
                They wanted no more of the early Cham architecture. Early Cham art focused on simple motifs. It lacked
                in sophistication, but they made beautiful monuments.
                The refinement you will find the Banh It Towers or Silver Towers. They built the towers up on the hill.
                First, the smaller towers and then the main tower: the most important temple. This the one with the
                statue of Shiva. The complex is constructed as a sort of pyramid. Constant wars with the Khmers also
                demanded their toll. Some towers were destroyed. Fortunately, some were already renovated.</p>

              <p> Among the silence, tourists can just about hear the twitters of birds and bats nesting in the main
                tower.</p>

              <p> To get to the towers, tourists need to conquer a small sloping road paved with bricks and lined by
                tree shapes. On the peak at a few dozen meters above sea level, not only can you sense the boundless of
                heaven but also can take a panoramic view of scattered houses, green farms in the villages and winding
                rivers and streams below.</p>

              <p>Lying 6km away from Quy Nhon, Hon Kho island is a giant shield protecting Nhon Hai fishing village. The
                island is called Hon Kho as there is nothing there but dangerous dry cliffs striving towards the sea. On
                this island, the sea breeze jokingly shoves into the cliffs in all four seasons while white waves
                excitingly carve into the nearby cliffs, creating cliffs off all shapes. Hon Kho island is also well
                known to adventure lovers. It forces adventurers to gasp for air from this steep adge to the others,
                then grants them the great peaceful and powerful felling when reaching the top. From this top, people
                can capture a panoramic view of entire Quy Nhon city.</p>

              <p>Beaches at Hon Kho island still manages to keep its pristine beauty. Not only do they own blue crystal
                waters, but they are also hugged by colorful coral reefs. Snorkerling is a tourist specialty of Hon Kho
                island. In addition, visitors can enjoy delicious fresh seafood prepared by local people served with
                spicy bold-flavored Bau Da wine, leaving you an unforgettable impression about the great culture of Binh
                Dinh.</p>
